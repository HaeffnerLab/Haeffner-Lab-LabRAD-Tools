"""
This file defines a class called sequence_analyzer, whose purpose is to take raw information from the pulser server,
(namely, the information that sequence_analyzer gets initialized with: human_readable_ttl, human_readable_dds, and channels)
process it, and create a plot of it.
The dds_box class is essentially a wrapper for a matplotlib.collections.PolyCollection object, which is created when plotting
the pulse sequence when fill_between is called to produce the colored boxes which represent the frequency of a pulse.
